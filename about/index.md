### About the CAM COST Map
{#about}
The CAM cost map provides information that may help interested parties determine whether they can economically deploy next generation networks for the same amount of federal support or less than that calculated by the Connect America Cost Model, Version 4.0 (CACM).
{.intro #about}

The map displays the outputs of the CACM, which calculates costs per location for the entire country. Areas marked as “served” are believed to have Internet access of at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream from a cable or fixed-wireless provider (according to State Broadband Initiative data, round 7, data as of December 2012) that reports it provides voice service on FCC Form 477 and does not receive high-cost USF support.

Areas on the map fall into one of 6 categories: served/above cost, served/between cost, served/below cost, unserved/above cost, unserved/between cost, and unserved/below cost. This is conceptually similar to the Connect America Cost Model maps recently released by the Wireline Competition Bureau to assist the public in identifying areas that may be eligible for ongoing Connect America support. There are, however, several distinctions. This map:

* Presents information calculated by the current version of the CACM for the entire country, regardless of whether the incumbent telephone provider is a price cap carrier or a rate-of-return carrier. 
* Uses a per customer monthly revenue assumption of $50, which is slightly different than the maps previously released by the Wireline Competition Bureau, which use either a $48 or $52 funding threshold.
* Assumes a higher “extremely high cost” threshold for rate of return areas than it does for price cap areas.

As you zoom into the map and place your cursor in a given area, the map will give you more information, commonly called a mouse over. Once you get near the county level, US Census tracts appear on the map, and as you pan over the map with your mouse, the right hand side of the map displays information about that tract.

We show the US Tract Number, the County, and the Total Locations in the tract. Additionally, we show the number of locations above and between the funding thresholds for both price cap and rate of return areas within the tract. Finally, we show the price cap and rate of return annual support for that tract calculated by the model, and the total calculated support. All of this data is direct from the model output.

A few caveats about the information presented by this map. The map does not show the level of support currently received either by price cap carriers or rate of return carriers. It is not intended to show the level of support that will be offered to price cap carriers as part of the Connect America Fund, as the cost model has not yet been finalized. The map is meant to be indicative of the areas that are uneconomic to serve, showing the approximate amount of support necessary according to the current version of the model. The information is intended to be helpful to parties planning on filing expressions of interest, but is not meant to indicate precise levels of support. The Commission previously stated that it expects that the amount of funding to be made available in the experiments will not exceed the amount of model- calculated support associated with the relevant geographic areas. A model, any model, is based on a variety of assumptions.

Finally, we emphasize that parties should make their own estimates as to the amount of federal support necessary to serve high cost areas, based on their knowledge of local geography, the population to be served, and their individual network costs. Where a party has ready assets in place that can be leveraged or other sources of funding for broadband deployment, or can partner with others, the actual costs may well be less than the model-calculated costs. That is what we are seeking to learn and one reason for making this map and calculations available in this format.
