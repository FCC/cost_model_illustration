### About the CAM Cost Map
{#about}
The CAM cost map provides information that may help interested parties determine whether they can economically deploy next generation networks for the same amount of federal support or less than that calculated by the Connect America Cost Model, Version 4.0 (CACM).
{.intro #about}

The map displays the outputs of the CACM, which calculates costs per location for the entire country. Areas marked as “served” are believed to have Internet access of at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream from a cable or fixed-wireless provider (according to State Broadband Initiative data, round 7, data as of December 2012) that reports it provides voice service on FCC Form 477 and does not receive high-cost USF support.

Areas on the map fall into one of 6 categories: served/above cost, served/between cost, served/below cost, unserved/above cost, unserved/between cost, and unserved/below cost. This is conceptually similar to the Connect America Cost Model maps recently released by the Wireline Competition Bureau to assist the public in identifying areas that may be eligible for ongoing Connect America support. There are, however, several distinctions. This map:

* Presents information calculated by the current version of the CACM for the entire country, regardless of whether the incumbent telephone provider is a price cap carrier or a rate-of-return carrier. 
* Uses a per customer monthly revenue assumption of $50, which is slightly different than the maps previously released by the Wireline Competition Bureau, which use either a $48 or $52 funding threshold.
* Assumes a higher “extremely high cost” threshold for rate of return areas than it does for price cap areas.

As you zoom into the map and place your cursor in a given area, the map will give you more information, commonly called a mouse over. Once you get near the county level, US Census tracts appear on the map, and as you pan over the map with your mouse, the right hand side of the map displays information about that tract.

We show the US Tract Number, the County, and the Total Locations in the tract. Additionally, we show the number of locations above and between the funding thresholds for both price cap and rate of return areas within the tract. Finally, we show the price cap and rate of return annual support for that tract calculated by the model, and the total calculated support. All of this data is direct from the model output.

A few caveats about the information presented by this map. The map does not show the level of support currently received either by price cap carriers or rate of return carriers. It is not intended to show the level of support that will be offered to price cap carriers as part of the Connect America Fund, as the cost model has not yet been finalized. The map is meant to be indicative of the areas that are uneconomic to serve, showing the approximate amount of support necessary according to the current version of the model. The information is intended to be helpful to parties planning on filing expressions of interest, but is not meant to indicate precise levels of support. The Commission previously stated that it expects that the amount of funding to be made available in the experiments will not exceed the amount of model- calculated support associated with the relevant geographic areas. A model, any model, is based on a variety of assumptions.

Finally, we emphasize that parties should make their own estimates as to the amount of federal support necessary to serve high cost areas, based on their knowledge of local geography, the population to be served, and their individual network costs. Where a party has ready assets in place that can be leveraged or other sources of funding for broadband deployment, or can partner with others, the actual costs may well be less than the model-calculated costs. That is what we are seeking to learn and one reason for making this map and calculations available in this format.

### Frequently Asked Questions
{#faq}
**Why are you releasing this map?**

In its recent Technology Transitions Order, the Commission initiated a rural broadband experiment to inform our policy decisions regarding the deployment of next generation networks in rural, high-cost areas.  One of the Commission’s objectives in conducting this experiment is to learn whether providers are willing and able to deliver broadband with performance characteristics well in excess of the current minimum standards for broadband Internet access for the same amount of support – or less – than might be made available by a forward-looking, fiber-to-the-premise cost model estimate.

To that end, this map provides information that may help interested parties determine whether they can economically deploy next generation networks for the same amount of federal support or less than that calculated by the Connect America Cost Model, Version 4.0.  The Wireline Competition Bureau is developing the Connect America Cost Model for the purpose of making an offer of support to price cap carriers in exchange for a state-level commitment.

**What does the map show?**

The Connect America Cost Model calculates the cost of deploying a greenfield fiber-to-the-premises network on a per location basis at the Census block level for the entire country.  The map graphic shows the cost category for each census block, subject to certain important assumptions; the mouse-over data to the right displays the amount of high cost support the incumbent carriers would be offered according to the current rules of the Connect America Fund Phase II to serve every location in the Census tract.

**What notable assumptions were made in the generation of this map?**

When viewing this map, you should be aware that it assumes:  
- A lower funding threshold of $50, the assumed monthly revenue per location passed. This is slightly different than the maps previously released by the Wireline Competition Bureau, which use either a $48 or $52 funding threshold.  
- A higher “extremely high cost” threshold for rate of return areas than it does for price cap areas.   

This map is not intended to show the level of support that will be offered to price cap carriers as part of the Connect America Fund, as the cost model has not yet been finalized. Release of these illustrative results in no way prejudges where the funding threshold and extremely high-cost thresholds will be finalized for purposes of the offer of model-based support to price cap carriers, nor does it prejudge any future decisions regarding which areas will be eligible in a competitive bidding mechanism to occur after the model-based support to price cap carriers.

**How should I read the map?**

As you zoom into the map and place your cursor in a given area, the map will give you more information, commonly called a mouse over. Once you get near the county level, US Census tracts appear on the map, and as you pan over the map with your mouse, the right hand side of the map displays information about that tract.

We show the US Tract Number, the County, and the Total Locations in the tract. Additionally, we show the number of locations above and between the funding thresholds for both price cap and rate of return areas within the tract. Finally, we show the price cap and rate of return annual support for that tract calculated by the model, and the total calculated support. All of this data is direct from the model output.

**What do the colored areas on the map represent?**

Areas on the map are defined along two axes.  First, each area is either “served” or “unserved.”  Second, each area is one of “above cost,” (i.e., the average cost for serving that area falls above the extremely high cost threshold)  “between cost” (i.e., the average cost for serving that area falls below the extremely high cost threshold but above the $50 funding threshold), or “below cost” (i.e., below the $50 funding threshold).

**What does “served” mean for the purposes of this map?**

Areas marked as “served” are believed to have Internet access of at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream from an unsubsidized competitor that reports it provides voice service on FCC Form 477 and does not receive high-cost USF support (e.g., a cable or fixed-wireless provider).[^1]  

We note that this map does not identify areas that are believed to have Internet access of at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream from a subsidized competitor.  Those counts of locations in those areas are reported in the block and tract data files.

**What are “high cost areas” for the purposes of this map?**

For the purposes of this exercise, “high cost areas” are those areas where the geographic and demographic characteristics are estimated to economically preclude the deployment of broadband networks absent some level of government support. In simple terms, network deployment is uneconomic when the expected cost of the operation and maintenance of the network, the depreciation expense of the assets, and the return on investment are greater than the expected revenue.

For the purposes of this map, “high cost areas” are those areas where the model predicts that the average cost for serving the area falls below the extremely high cost threshold but above the $50 funding threshold.

**Why doesn’t the model show that support is available for serving extremely high cost areas?**

The Connect America Cost Model was designed for the purpose of making an offer of support to price cap carriers in exchange for a state-level commitment.  The Commission decided that model-based support would not be made available to locations above an extremely high cost threshold.[^2] Extremely high cost locations are not, therefore, included for the purposes of calculating the support amounts displayed on this map.[^3]

We note however, that the Commission explicitly invited proposals that include extremely high cost locations.[^4] To facilitate analysis, the map identifies the number of extremely high cost locations in each census tract.  Applicants are encouraged to explain how and whether they plan to serve those extremely high cost locations, how those locations affect the amount of support they are requesting (if at all), and what assumptions, if any, they make about the support necessary to serve extremely high cost locations in a tract as compared to the high cost locations in a tract.

**How does this map differ from other maps showing Connect America Cost Model data released by the Wireline Competition Bureau?**

This map is conceptually similar to the Connect America Cost Model maps recently released by the Wireline Competition Bureau to assist the public in identifying areas that may be eligible for ongoing Connect America support. There are, however, several distinctions. This map:  
- Presents information calculated by the current version of the Connect America Cost Model for the entire country, regardless of whether the incumbent telephone provider is a price cap carrier or a rate-of-return carrier.  
- Uses a per customer monthly revenue assumption of $50, which is slightly different than the maps previously released by the Wireline Competition Bureau, which use either a $48 or $52 funding threshold.  
- Assumes a higher “extremely high cost” threshold for rate of return areas than it does for price cap areas.

**What are the current minimum standards for broadband Internet access?**

The minimum standards established for price cap carriers accepting model-based support in Phase II are to deliver speeds of at least 4 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream, with round trip provider latency not to exceed 100 milliseconds, with a minimum of 100 GB of usage, at a price reasonably comparable to the price of similar terrestrial wireline offerings in urban areas.[^5]

**What DOESN’T this map show?**

This map does not show:  
- The level of support currently received either by price cap carriers or rate of return carriers.  
- It is not intended to show the level of support that will be offered to price cap carriers as part of the Connect America Fund, as the cost model has not yet been finalized. 

**Does this map tell me how much money I can get to build out a network in a given area?**

No.  The map is meant to be indicative of the areas that the model predicts are uneconomic to serve, showing the approximate amount of support necessary according to the current version of the model. The information is intended to be helpful to parties planning on filing expressions of interest, but is not meant to indicate precise levels of support. 

**How much money does the Commission plan to make available for this experiment?**

The Commission will establish a budget for this experiment in an order to be adopted later this year.[^6]

**Anything else I should know?**

We emphasize that parties should make their own estimates as to the amount of federal support necessary to serve high cost areas, based on their knowledge of local geography, the population to be served, and their individual network costs. Where a party has ready assets in place that can be leveraged or other sources of funding for broadband deployment, or can partner with others, the actual costs may well be less than the model-calculated costs. That is what we are seeking to learn and one reason for making this map and calculations available in this format.
