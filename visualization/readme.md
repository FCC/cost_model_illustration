The cam_eperiement folder contains the mapbox project files for producing the cost_model_illustration map base tiles.  This base tiles are only the shading of block files.  The project was created in two phases;
- phase 1 is a tile set based on the lower 48; the data is driven off a postGIS table;
- phase 2 is set of tiles for Alaska, HI, and the island territories; this data was driven off a shape file.
